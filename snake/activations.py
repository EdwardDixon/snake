class Snake(nn.Module):
    '''
    Implementation of a rather serpentine sine-based periodic activation function 

    Shape:
        - Input: (N, *) where * means, any number of additional
          dimensions
        - Output: (N, *), same shape as the input

    Parameters:
        - alpha - trainable parameter

    References:
        - This activation function is from this paper by Liu Ziyin, Tilman Hartwig, Masahito Ueda:

    Examples:
        >>> a1 = snake(256)
        >>> x = torch.randn(256)
        >>> x = a1(x)

        Initialization.
        INPUT:
            - in_features: shape of the input
            - alpha: trainable parameter
            
            alpha is initialized to 1 by default, higher values = higher-frequency, 
            5-50 is a good starting point if you already think your data is periodic, 
            consider starting lower e.g. 0.5 if you think not, but don't worry, 
            alpha will be trained along with the rest of your model.
